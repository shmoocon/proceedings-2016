# The Shmoo Group

The Shmoo Group is a think-tank of like-minded individuals who share a passion for information security research and development.  TSG membersâ€™ expertise incorporates field-dressing a moose to extragalactic astrophysics to Python capabilities, cutting-edge wearable computing to encryption to sharp-shooting.  The group mind adds a razor-sharp sense of sarcasm to a refusal to take anything about the Internet seriously, mixed liberally with tequila, community service, wireless networking and RFID hackery.
