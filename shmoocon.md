# ShmooCon

**DIFFERENT** – ShmooCon is an annual east coast hacker convention hell-bent on offering three days of an interesting atmosphere for demonstrating technology exploitation, inventive software and hardware solutions, and open discussions of critical infosec issues.  The first day is a single track of speed talks called One Track Mind.  The next two days bring three tracks:  Build It, Belay It, and Bring It On.

**AFFORDABLE** – ShmooCon is about high quality without the high price.  Keep in mind that space is limited, and we’ve sold out quickly every year.

**ACCESSIBLE** – ShmooCon is held in Washington, DC at the Washington Hilton about four blocks from the DC Metro’s Dupont Circle Station.  Fly into DCA, IAD, or BWI or take a train to Union Station, and you’re just a short cab ride away from the con.

**ENTERTAINING** – Brain melting from all the cool tech you’re learning?  Be sure to check out the other events running during ShmooCon, including the Lockpick Village, ShmooCon Labs, Hack Fortress, and more.

**SHMOOCON SUPPORTS THE FREE AND OPEN EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION**.  We are proud to have attendees with unique and diverse viewpoints on just about any topic.  We want to foster the exchange of ideas among attendees and think the community benefits from inclusiveness.  To that end, we are committed to providing a friendly, lively, and welcoming environment for all.  For your part, please be awesome to one another.

What is awesome?  In the most simplest terms it means tolerance and respect.  We value free speech and we also value our attendees and desire no one to be marginalized or intimidated.  Everyone is welcome at ShmooCon.

If someone is not being awesome to you or you see someone not being awesome, please tell a staff member.  If you yourself are not being awesome, be aware that you may be asked to leave the conference and no refund will be given.
